# Spec Generation

Generate structured specification files for choochoo.

**IMPORTANT: NEVER add `<?xml version="1.0"...?>` to spec files. These are markdown files, NOT XML files. Start directly with `<project_specification>`.**

## Critical Format Rules

1. **YAML frontmatter required** - Every spec starts with `---` frontmatter block
2. **NO XML DECLARATION** - NEVER include `<?xml ...?>` - this breaks the spec
3. **File is markdown with XML-like tags** - Not a true XML file
4. **Empty review tags** - Use `<review></review>` not self-closing
5. **After frontmatter** - First XML line must be `<project_specification>`

## YAML Frontmatter

Every spec file MUST start with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "Project or Feature Name"
created: 2026-01-11
poured: []
iteration: 1
auto_discovery: false
auto_learnings: false
---
```

Fields:
- **title**: Human-readable name for the spec (matches `<project_name>`)
- **created**: Date created (use `date +%Y-%m-%d` bash command for accuracy)
- **poured**: Array of root bead IDs created when `/pour` runs (starts empty)
- **iteration**: Refinement count (1 = initial, increments on each `/spec` refinement)
- **auto_discovery**: (optional, default: `false`) Enable auto task creation from discovered gaps during implementation
- **auto_learnings**: (optional, default: `false`) Enable auto skill creation from learnings captured during implementation

## Core Principles

1. **Flexible scale**: Same format works for one feature or entire applications
2. **Human-reviewable**: Easy to read and edit in any text editor
3. **Machine-parseable**: Clear structure for automated processing

## Spec Format

The spec uses YAML frontmatter followed by XML-like tags in markdown for clarity and editability.

```markdown
---
title: "Project or Feature Name"
created: 2026-01-11
poured: []
iteration: 1
auto_discovery: false
auto_learnings: false
---
<project_specification>
<project_name>Project or Feature Name</project_name>

## Scaling the Format

### Simple Feature (1-3 tasks)

```markdown
---
title: "Dark Mode Toggle"
created: 2026-01-11
poured: []
iteration: 1
auto_discovery: false
auto_learnings: false
---
<project_specification>
  <project_name>Dark Mode Toggle</project_name>
  <overview>Add dark mode to settings page.</overview>
  <tasks>
    <task id="dark-mode" priority="2" category="functional">
      <title>Implement Dark Mode Toggle</title>
      <description>Add toggle, persist to localStorage, apply theme.</description>
      <steps>
        - Add toggle to settings
        - Create theme context
        - Persist preference
        - Update CSS variables
      </steps>
      <test_steps>
        1. Navigate to settings page
        2. Click the dark mode toggle
        3. Verify theme changes to dark
        4. Refresh the page
        5. Verify dark mode preference persisted
      </test_steps>
      <review></review>
    </task>
  </tasks>
</project_specification>
```

### Full Application (30+ tasks)

Include technology_stack, database_schema, api_endpoints, implementation_steps sections.
See `{{REFS:anthropic-spec-format}}` for complete example.

## Task State

Task state is determined by the `<review>` tag:

| State                | How to identify            | Action                                |
| -------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Needs refinement** | `<review>` tag has content | Run `/spec` again to process feedback |
| **Ready to pour**    | `<review>` tag is empty    | Can be poured into beads              |
| **Rejected**         | Task deleted from spec     | N/A                                   |

This keeps the workflow simple:

- Add feedback in `<review>` tags → run `/spec` to refine
- Clear `<review>` tags (or leave empty) → ready for `/pour`
- Delete tasks you don't want
- After pouring, spec is archived

## Priority Levels

| Priority | Meaning             |
| -------- | ------------------- |
| 0        | Critical - do first |
| 1        | High                |
| 2        | Medium (default)    |
| 3        | Low                 |
| 4        | Backlog             |

## Category Types

| Category         | Description                           |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `functional`     | Core features, business logic         |
| `style`          | Visual polish, animations, UI tweaks  |
| `infrastructure` | Build, deploy, tooling, project setup |
| `documentation`  | README, comments, docs                |

Categories help prioritize work - functional tasks typically come before style tasks.

## Test Steps (Integration Guidance)

The `<test_steps>` section in the spec provides **integration-level test guidance** for the feature as a whole. These are high-level verification steps that test the complete user flow.

**Important**: When the spec is poured into beads, the pour process generates **granular test steps** for each individual bead. The spec-level test steps guide the overall integration testing, while bead-level test steps verify the specific implementation.

Example flow:

- **Spec task**: "User Authentication" with test steps for complete login flow
- **Poured beads**: "Create login form", "Add validation", "Implement API endpoint" - each with their own granular test steps

## Granularity Guidelines

When `--target-tasks` is specified:

- Each task should be independently verifiable
- Tasks can have dependencies (expressed via order or explicit deps)
- Better to have more granular tasks than fewer large ones

## Context Section

The `<context>` section is populated by the `/spec` command using sub-agents that research the codebase and technologies before generating the spec. This ensures tasks are informed by the actual codebase.

| Section | Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `existing_patterns` | Code patterns to follow | "Components use shadcn/ui conventions" |
| `integration_points` | Files/services to integrate with | "Extends UserService in src/services/user.ts" |
| `new_technologies` | Research notes for new tech | "Stripe: Use webhook verification for security" |
| `conventions` | Naming, testing, style conventions | "Tests colocated with source (*.test.ts)" |

**For greenfield projects**: Context section may be minimal or empty, but should still include technology research if using unfamiliar tech.

**For existing codebases**: Context section should be thorough - tasks reference patterns and integration points to ensure consistency.
